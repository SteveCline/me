	<h1>How I would fix Healthcare</h1>
	<p>2/10/2019</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Healthcare is a huge </p>
	<div class="callout-box">
	<ul>
		<li>starts with a blank white HTML page</li>
		<li>follows web standards and semantics</li>
		<li>vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS</li>
		<li>classes and ids have meaning</li>
		<li>CSS and JS are seperate files from HTML</li>
		<li>made by one person or a small team</li>
		<li>elegant efforts to keep code base minimal as possible</li>
	</ul>	
	</div>
	<p>What Artisanal Web Design generally is NOT:</p>
	<div class="callout-box">
	<ul>
		<li>frameworks, templates, or CMS</li>
		<li>a build step</li>
		<li>needs transpiled or converted for a browser</li>
		<li>use of libraries such as JQuery, Bootstrap, React, Angular</li>
		<li>CSS mixed in JS</li>
		<li>use of package managers</li>
		<li>large teams</li>
	</ul>	
	</div>
	<p>I am sure many web developers will identify with this term and I am sure some not so much. The web is a big place and there seem like 10,000 ways to make a webpage. Artisnal Web Design is just one way I want to define. Deciding which way is best, which skills should be valued most, and what is the best way for new folks to enter the industry is beyond my expertise. We all have differnet experiences and different reasons we got into the web. We all have opinons, I just hope we can be cival and polite. One thing I do feel confindent about, I think the future holds opportunity for everyone no matter the particular skillset they arm themself with.</p>
	<p>Think of the artisan baker. They might not make as much money as a huge bread company, but they make a hand-crafted product they are proud of, even if it takes a bit longer and costs a bit more to produce. Maybe it is my hope that this term, Artisanal Web Design, gives value to those who feel undervalued and empowers them during this Great Divide.</p>
