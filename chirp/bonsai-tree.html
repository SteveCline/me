	<h1>Bonsai Tree</h1>
	<p>6/6/2020</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Recently I have repotted my bonsai tree for the first time. This was my first real repotting where I actually put the tree in a legit bonsai pot. The past two years it has been in a plastic growing pot. I didn't realize but my hometown of Harrisburg has an everything-you-need bonsai wearhouse called <a href="https://www.superflybonsai.com/">Superfly Bonsai</a>. I ordered online and made the short trip to pick up my $15 pot an hour later. I watched a few repotting videos on youtube but I mostly crossed my fingers during the repotting process. Trimmed the roots and replaced the soil.</p>
	<p>My tree is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum">giant sequoia</a> and is about 3 years old now. Nothing is more ironic than a miniture of the largest tree species on earth. It has been growing pretty well in Pennsylvania, I have it potted in a cactus soil mix which is light and peat mossy.</p>

	<p>Most of the care has been some light trimming and making sure to keep the soil moist as sequoia's like constantly damp soil from a humid environment. During the deep freeze of winter I bring it inside, but for the most part it just hangs in the backyard.</p>
