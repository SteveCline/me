	<h1>GIS Productivity Tools</h1>
	<p>12/1/2021</p>
	<hr>
	<p>TL;DR Please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SteveCline">sponsoring my work</a>.</p>
	<p>Last month I launched my newest desktop web app <a href="https://pdfmapmaker.com/" target="_blank">PDF Map Maker</a>. It is a free website to allow anyone to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a> data to a map, style it, label it, and create a professional looking map to download. This tool was born out of a need I saw with a company client. They had people who needed to make simple project maps, but who were not GIS pros or had access or knowledge of GIS software. This problem exists in offices everywhere and is a barrier of entry to learning the basics of GIS for so many. Planners, environmental scientists, researchers, project managers just need a nice map for their report. Now they have <a href="https://pdfmapmaker.com/" target="_blank">pdfmapmaker.com</a> to ease their pain.</p>

	<p>This project is part of a larger effort I am undertaking to build a set of GIS productivity tools as easy-to-use web apps anyone can use in their desktop web browser for free. My first app, which has been on the web for three years, is the GIS data creation and editing app <a href="https://vector.rocks/" target="_blank">vector.rocks</a>. Now you can draw and download GIS data in Vector and then add the data to PDF Map Maker for map production. In GIS speak, think of this as the difference between "Data View" (Vector) and "Layout View" (PDF Map Maker).</p>
	<p>The goal of building a suit of GIS productivity tools is simple: allow regular office workers to create geographic data and make maps with it. No expensive software. No need for advanced knowledge. I am re-thinking GIS's UI/UX with the hope that most people with basic computer skills can use these tools without being overwhelmed.</p>
	<h2>Why sponsor my work?</h2>
	<p>Asking for money is never easy. These tools could be behind a paywall as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">Software as a Service</a>, but I didn't want to do it that way. I want to provide simple yet professional mapping for all. These tools took me hundreds of hours to build and they could be so much more. I have had fleeting asperations of building my own web-based GIS. Maybe that dream can still be alive? The next GIS productivity tool I want to build is a tool to better search, query and download the vast amounts public GIS data availble on open data portals and <a href="https://mappingsupport.com/p/surf_gis/list-federal-state-county-city-GIS-servers.pdf">ArcGIS Servers</a>. While I would love to dedicate all my working time to these projects, we all need to earn a living. I realize asking people to voluntarily part with their money in support of this effort will be difficult. I am humbly and optimistically hoping others can see the value, vision and goals I have. If you do, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SteveCline">sponsoring my work</a> on GitHub and I will do my best to build the coolest GIS tools I can.</p>
