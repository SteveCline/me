	<h1>My Top Strava 2023</h1>
	<p>1/8/2024</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Strava has become my social media of choice and the way I track all the fun adventures we do. Sometimes I look back on a year and forget all the stuff we did. This year, I made a list of my top 22 activities to help me remember all the cool places and things that were done. 2023 was the year I turned 40 and I was able to check off a many bucket list activities.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>I hope to ride all the Oregon Scenic Bikeways, so early in 2023 I got to work.</p>
