	<h1>GeoJSON to Shapefile</h1>
	<p>6/9/2020</p>
	<hr>
	<p>No secret, I like geojson as geospatial data format. I just think it is simple, flexible, and interoperable. However, most of the GIS world likes shapefiles. They won't go away and it is probably the snarkiest data format on <a href="https://twitter.com/shapefiie?lang=en">twitter</a>. When people want geospatial data, they want a shapefile. Slightly depressing but it is still mostly true from my experience.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>You know what gives me comfort? –– <br>You know, I know, all my detractors know: when the chips are down y&#39;all will &quot;Export to shapefile&quot; <a href="https://t.co/xoBxpbzWJj">pic.twitter.com/xoBxpbzWJj</a></p>&mdash; ShapefiIe (@shapefiIe) <a href="https://twitter.com/shapefiIe/status/1054451201620828166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p>This past month, I updated my web-based geojson editor <a href="https://vector.rocks/">vector.rocks</a> to have the option to download the data as shapefile. Not surprisingly, this was one of the first requests I got when I first shared this project with my coworkers. My first thought was to use <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/shp-write">shp-write</a> to do the conversion. This project doesn't seem to be well maintained and intially didn't work for me, but I did get shp-write working after browsing some of the issues. I also noticed it didn't handle multi-part features and I wanted to minimize adding JavaScript so I kept looking.</p>
  <p>I next turned to <a href="http://ogre.adc4gis.com/">ogr2ogr</a> web client. I have been using this site for years to quickly convert data back and forth between geojson and other formats. At the bottom of the page is a short section for 'Acessing Ogre using a POST request'. No examples are given and I only have a little experience doing POST requests. I struggled for a bit to get this implemination right. Intitally it was getting the header information correct, then it was handling the response as a blob.</p>
  <p>In this example I used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch browser API</a> instead of an XHR request. I actually put together this exact same function as an XHR request as well, but for some reason I gravitate to fetch because I feel it is simple. Any thoughts on prefered async techniques?</p>
  <pre><code>
function convertGeoJsonToShpThenDownload(geoJson,filename){
  var url = "https://ogre.adc4gis.com/convertJson";
  var options = {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}, 
    body: "json=" + JSON.stringify(geoJson)
  };
  fetch(url,options)
  .then(function(response){
    return response.blob();
  })
  .then(function(data){
    var link = document.createElement("a");
    document.body.append(link);
    link.href = URL.createObjectURL(data);
    link.download = filename + ".zip";
    link.click();
  });
}

</code></pre>
<p>What this function does is take the response as a blob, creates an anchor element and then invokes a click event on it to start the download. The anchor element does not appear to be visible in your page. This initally was a concern of mine, but I found it not to be a problem for my use.</p>
<p>The one concern with this technique is geoJSON of differing geomeries as shapefiles can only support 1 geometry type, but this was not a concern of mine for Vector.</p>
<p>Add this function to any button's event listener and all of a sudden you have a shiny button to download some geoJSON as a shapefile. The one unsolved concern is how to set the name of the shapefile itself from the resulting zipped download.</p>
