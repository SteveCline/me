	<h1>My Relationship with Religion</h1>

	<p>So tell me if I am understanding biblical doctrine correctly?</p>
	<p>God made me and all other persons of the earth past, present and future. God created/designed me (and everyone) fallen, sinful, and with free will. If I use that free will and choose not to worship God/Jesus or withhold belief that God/Jesus is my savior (for the sins), even if I live a decent moral life by most current cultural measures, I will be subjected to eternal torment and punishment once I die. To me, this entity we refer to as God seems to be a narcissistic and out of line with my own concept of morality. Infinite punishment for the finite crime of lack of belief in something that lacks good evidence to me. Cruel and manipulative.</p>
	<p>The fact is my rational thought leads me to withhold and question belief and I can't change that (without trying to psychologically manipulate myself). In my human experince, I perceive a lack of sufficient evidence and I don't fully understand what the abstraction of a God even is (can something be 'real' if it does not exist in space time?).</p>
	<p>Sure, I could say I believe or act like I do, but that would be in vain and God knows my thoughts as I am told (no secret is safe from him). My brain and its logic tell me its mythology, so I suppose I will be joining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqBLaTpAKM">Carl Sagan</a> in an eternity of suffering all for being curious and unconcluded.</p>
	<p>Luckily, I withhold belief, so my conscience is not shackled with that idea of eternal suffering. I live free from the debated rules-of-judgement by an abstract creator. I live happy, comfortable, and with a free conscience. I design my morality on a humanistic scale: enhance well-being (healthy human flourishing) and limit unchosen human suffering when possible (both present and future people). Favor the awe inspiring earth with its plants, animals, water, soil and air, and it will in turn will be favorable to humans. That is a doctrine to live by.</p>
