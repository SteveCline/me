	<h1>Meeting</h1>
	<p>1/6/2024</p>
	<hr>
	<p>My name is Steve Cline, I live in the Bagley Downs neighborhood along 4th Plain Blvd. I am a cyclist, a rider of the vine, and a motorist.  The recent improvements along 4th Plain Blvd have made cycling safer and have made trips riding the Vine smoother. As a motorist, driving along the corridor feels safer and there are less speeding drivers, all while keeping traffic flowing like pre-project conditions.</p>
	<p>My wife and I are a one-car household, and she commonly commutes to work by bike. When my wife takes her bike to work, she previously avoided the most direct route to work, which was along 4th Plain, for safety reasons. She now feels safe enough to bike down the corridor and shop along 4th plain businesses by bike.</p>
	<p>These recent improvements allow our household and our neighbors to choose from a variety of modes to safely commute downtown, and shop along 4th Plain corridor. </p>
	<p>Before the project began, the city engaged the community and gave us multiple chances to have our voices heard. I attended public meetings on the project, I received emails, and made my voice heard with the online survey. The city even attended our neighborhood meeting to inform us how to be engaged on the project.</p>
	<p>Save Vancouver Streets, accuses the city of not doing public involvement, OR addressing neighborhood concerns, OR listening before a transportation project. This is FLATLY a LIE and they know it. They didn't get their way on a project so they have resorted to disinformation to gain signatures for their initiative.</p>
	<p>I agree, everyone has the right to heard before a project, but just because you didn't get your preference doesn't mean the city didn't do their job or considered your concerns.</p>
	<p>Because of this, I ask the city clerk to TAKE NO ACTION on the Save our Streets initiative.</p>
