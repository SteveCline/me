	<h1>My Top Strava 2024</h1>
	<p>12/31/2024</p>
	<hr>
	<p>2024 took me on many new adventures. This year I selected 23 activities, which included another Oregon Scenic Bikeway and three more bucket list mountain bike rides. This year I did activities in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and British Columbia to round out my geographic spread.</p>
	<hr>
	<!--Springwater Corridor-->
	<p>We started 2024 off on a sunny but chilly day on the Springwater Corridor.</p>
